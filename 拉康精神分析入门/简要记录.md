## 1 signifier & signified 能指所指

Jacques Lacan, The Instance of the Letter in the Unconscious, 1957. (influence from Ferdinand de Saussure)

What are signs? 

Meaning of the Letter




signifier → signified;

signifier → new signified (the meaning given by society may change) (the signifier represses the signified)

Why do we use them? 

The Signifying Chain


word → sentence → paragraph → context

语言作为一种被不同主体共享的存在，我能够将其用于表示与其字面意义截然不同的东西。这种言说功能可以指示主体在寻求真理的过程中的位置。

How do they come into being?

Metonymy 转喻: 一词替换另一词，所指不变。

	e.g. 30 sails = 30 ships
	
	displacement 置换 (feelings/behavior from original objects ---transfer to--- another person/thing)

Metaphor 隐喻: 一词替换另一词，与主体无直接联系。

	e.g. His sheaf was neither miserly nor hateful. → "sheaf"=the hero Booz, "his"=possession, implying Capitalist Competition; it tries to lose the negative aspects of Booz by replacing him by "his sheaf".
	
	condensation 凝缩 (the repressed returns in a hidden way)

the symptom (对积极的渴望)



conclusion

Linguistic & Unconscious

Lacan: "The unconscious is structured like a language."

free association 自由联想

It is not that our desires are expressed through language, but the language creates the desires...It is language that enabled us to become conscious.



## 2 Three Registers 三界


Zizek用棋类游戏对三界作出比喻：

Symbolic 象征界，游戏规则(如何走棋)

Imaginary 想象界，游戏中的角色/棋子

Real 现实界，玩游戏时的现实情况



The Imaginary

The Mirror Stage: 婴儿渐渐认出镜子中的是自己，并认同镜中那个完整理想的自我形象（而非现实中支离破碎的自己）（某与其自身现实的不一致）

	per-sona (through-sound) “声音穿过”，本指面具，如今指“(个)人”(person)
	
	人际交往中同样可以照见自己，we are only ourselves in the reflection of the other

随人成长、变得愈发成熟，the realization of the otherness, the effect of the other on our image of ourselves



The Symbolic (signifier & signified)

the 'big Other' 大写的他者，建构我们现实经验的看不见的秩序、使我们如是看待世界的规则与意义的复杂网络。

the-name-of-the-father, god

the-no-of-the-father, culture, the ever judging father, the symbol of authority

imaginary + symbolic → our representation of our reality



The Real

The Real ≠ mother nature, our experience, or external reality

(Kant, 永远无法相及的概念&实在？)

Reality is our escape from the real. (If reality is structured by fantasy, imaginary & symbolic, and the fantasy is our protection from being directly overwhelmed by the raw Real, then reality itself can function as an escape from encountering the Real.)

在现实界中找到 unconscious forces, desires, truths



## 3 他者

the Borromean knot (trinity), 'object petit a' in the center


What is object a?

When we look in the mirror and found the ideal I, we realize we are not the ideal I, or the only desire object in others' mind. We think we lack the phallus, and want to fill our void to reach our true enjoyment, Jouissance.

We try to reach something that we never had in the first place, we never had our perfect Jouissance. But we retroactively produce this illusion as soon as restrictions are placed on our enjoyment. (castration)

Why would the Big Other want to prevent our Jouissance?

Jouissance, surplus enjoyment, pleasure in pain, the death drive (we just want more all the time)


The object a is not what we actually lost, but the constant sense we have that something is lacking from our lives. We are always searching, and whenever we achieve the goals there is always something more we desire. The object a is not the object itself, but the function of masking the lack.

Why is object a in the center?

Symbolic register


Imaginary register

where we can once again imagine ourselves to be one with our Jouissance, where the Other is not present, and our desires can be reality.

Fantasy provides a 'schema' according to which certain positive objects in reality can function as objects of desire, filling in the empty places opened up by the formal symbolic structure. fantasy帮我们根据现实建构了一个幻想对象(给出一个解决方案)，告诉我们现实中的什么是值得欲望、幻想的。

Real register

"The Real is what resists symbolization absolutely."
